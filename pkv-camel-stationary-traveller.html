I used to listen to this program on a local radio station which played niche art rock or neo-progressive rock or whatever you call it. The song was most likely instrumental. It consisted mostly of long, slow, melancholic "intro" played on Pan's pipes. The "intro" lasted for a few minutes and eventually transformed into slow, "epic" electric guitar solo finale, which was slightly repetitive and possibly ended with a fade-out.

Every instrument has their place and every member of the band shines bright, musically and technically. Breathless would probably be second, and I also like Stationary Traveller  But the thing is that I haven't even listened to every album! I absolutely love the songs Rajaz and Sahara, but since the Camel Productions' albums can't be streamed anywhere I guess.

I was somewhat disappointed with this album. With the exception of some nice guitar playing from Andy Latimer, the music on Stationary Traveler (1984) is nothing more than bland, 1980s corporate. So I don't think I've ever had as much trouble with a band as I have with Camel, because they both made some of the best music I've ever heard and some of the worst. At this point I own 3 of their albums: Rajaz, Mirage ,and Breathless  Rajaz is actually proving to be one of my all time favorite albums. I absolutely adore it.
