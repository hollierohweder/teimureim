I got a cheap rc heli for Christmas. Thought it would be a little gadget I would use a few times and forget about. But I can't put the ting down and its a cheap 2ch. So I've been doing a little research and a symia looks to be recommended. But I also see the v911 recommended a good bit. It's double the price. Should I just skip the symia and grab the v911 off amazon? EDIT: I'm also considering just getting this: http://www.amazon.com/Seresroad-Cheerson-2-4GHz-Rechargeable-Quadcopter/dp/B00N.  I'm trying to follow some of the basic tutorials on the GitHub, and I'm having difficulties with plot_histogram.

I don't loose any FPS in game, but I go from 60 in OBS to around 20 or less sometimes. I don't know what the issue would be. Maybe my CPU can't handle the load, but I don't think that should be the problem. \ Video\ BaseCX=1920 x BaseCY=1080 OutputCX=1280 x OutputCY=720 FPSType=0 FPSCommon=60 \ SimpleOutput\ VBitrate=2500. we had an issue with this at work today. https://3dground.net/article/attention-alc-and-crp-viruses-in-3ds-max- (https://3dground.net/article/attention-alc-and-crp-viruses-in-3ds-max-) This seems to be the code which the virus adds to the max file (as plain text): you can text search the max files for bits of this to detect if they have the issue. Autodesk support actually provided us with a fix, so you don't need to buy anything to get passed. So, Ready Player One was great, right? Lots of fun, lots of nostalgia, lots of references.
